# TrueLearn - AI-powered Learning Assistant

TrueLearn, the powerhouse of Simesta AI is part an innovative learning assistant application that harnesses the power of AI to create personalized learning experiences for users. It interacts with the user and determines the way they learn best and teaches them "ANY" course of their choice based on that learning method.

The backend server is live at [https://truelearn-production.up.railway.app](https://truelearn-production.up.railway.app)

## Project Overview(Truelearn API)

This repository contains the backend code for the TrueLearn application, built with Express and TypeScript. It serves as the core engine for the entire TrueLearn platform.

### Key Features:

- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Users can input a course title (and optionally specify topics, and any relevant file ) and TrueLearn generates a tailored learning journey with both textual and video content.
- **Text Generation**: The application leverages the Gemini Pro model to create comprehensive textual learning materials.
- **Image Generation**: Using the Imagen model, TrueLearn provides visual aids in the form of images based on the learning content.
- **Video Integration**: By utilizing the YouTube API, TrueLearn incorporates relevant videos into the learning path.
- **Secure Authentication**: User access is protected through Google OAuth2 authorization and token-based authentication using JWT.

### Technologies Used:

- **Backend Framework**: Express, TypeScript
- **AI Models**:
  - Text Generation: Gemini Pro
  - Image Generation: Imagen
- **External API**: YouTube API
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth2, JWT

This backend serves as the foundation for the TrueLearn ecosystem, providing robust API endpoints and AI-driven functionalities to power the learning experience across all TrueLearn platforms.
